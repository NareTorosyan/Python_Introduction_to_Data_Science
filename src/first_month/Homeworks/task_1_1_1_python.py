#1Given two whole numbers - the lengths of the legs of a right-angled triangle - output its area.
a = 3
b = 4
s = (a*b)/2 # to get the area of the right angle triangle we multiply the values of angles and divide by two
print(s)

#2Input a natural number n and output its last digit.
n = 569
n=str(n)
last_digit = int(n[len(n)-1])
print(last_digit)

#3Input a two-digit natural number and output the sum of its digits.
n = int(a)&int(b)
a=5
b=7
m = a+b
print(m)

#4 You are given the first and second number in an arithmetic progression and natural number  n. Find n-th element of arithmetic progression.
a= 5
b = 10
n = 3
c = a + (n-1)*(b-a)
print(c)
